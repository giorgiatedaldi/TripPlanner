# TripPlanner
### Project objective
The objective of this project is to develop an application the user can use to plan and to keep tracks of his / her trips.

### Features
Every trip is characterized by:
- name and description
- start and end date
- a list of intermediate stages. Each one of them is composed by:
  - a movement: has a departure-arrival place along with a date (eg. from Milan to Rome on June 15th)
  - a stay: has a place of stay and arrival-departure dates (eg. Rome from 15 June to 18 June)
- a list of additional information  that is deemed relevant by the user

It's possible to create, update and delete any trip.
For each trip a map representing the stages can be displayed.
The user will receive a push notification when there are 24 hours left before the trip.
